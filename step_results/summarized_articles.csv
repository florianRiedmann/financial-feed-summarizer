products, Hindo said.', 'Their appeal will initially be to certain segments of the market who are willing to accept trade-offs for new benefits.', 'At this juncture, the three new benefits for streaming services are lower price, new content and mobility, i.e., access to programming anywhere on any device.', 'The drawbacks are lack of quality content, such as live sports, and a confusing array of options, rather than the one-bundle-fits-all approach of cable.', 'If streaming products can actually get to profitability — most of the major companies are predicting they will hit this point in three to five years — they will then be able to expand their reach and improve their offerings to accelerate the demise of cable TV, Hindo said.', 'Historically, publicly traded incumbents, such as Disney and NBCUniversal, have been poorly positioned to keep up with disruptors, said Hindo.', 'They are too wedded to profitable models to purposefully innovate against themselves with niche products that come with disadvantages.', 'Then again, Disney and NBCUniversal know this.', ""Their executives have likely read Christensen's book and other common business-school textbooks about how

the U.S. and China unleashed animal spirits, or the Federal Reserve's massive bond-buying is working its magic."", 'But if the rally is purely driven by expectations for a rapid rebound in earnings growth and the global economy, this level of enthusiasm should elicit concerns.', 'The problem front and center is how investors are looking past the continuous earnings rout, betting on a snapback as soon as the first quarter of 2020.', 'S&P 500 earnings are expected to drop by 0.3% in the fourth quarter of 2019, marking the first back-to-back quarterly decline since 2016, according to

near lockstep with the stock market's climb."", 'The balance sheet has expanded 10% since October, while the S&P 500 shot up 12%, including notching its best fourth quarter since 2013.', ""Whether one

as the indexes have sped to new highs, plenty of observers have argued that a relative shortage of stocks combined with somewhat mechanical sources of demand explain everything from Dow 29,000 to the trio of trillion-dollar market-cap giants that tower above the rest of the market.', ""The idea of an equity shortage usually hinges on the decline in the total number of U.S. public companies in recent decades, the relative dearth of initial public offerings and the consistent flow of share buybacks meant to reduce companies' equity base."", 'These are all features of this bull market, for sure.', ""But it's an oversimplification to focus on the absolute number of stocks or the background hum of stock buybacks as key drivers of the market's historic run."", ""There are plenty of stocks to go around and buybacks aren't wagging the indexes – it's just that everyone wants the same kind of stocks."", ""What's truly scarce are big, reliable cash flows that investors believe will endure economic wobbles and constant technological disruption."", 'And this perceived scarcity of safe sources of profit and income is animating voracious demand for corporate debt and propelling the elite class of dominant secular-growth stocks to ever-richer valuations.', ""That's not to deny there are literally fewer stocks on the market's shelves than there used to be."", 'The comprehensive Dow Jones Wilshire 5000 index now has about 3,500 domestic stocks, down from more than 7,000 in the late 1990s.', 'But most of the stocks that went away were tiny, marginal companies.', 'And the total number of issues has been about steady since 2012, and since then the Wilshire 5000 has more than doubled.', 'If the reduced number of stocks were an issue, then why would one-sixth of the names in the S&P 500 be languishing at 12-times forecast earnings or less?', ""And if public investors didn't have enough names to choose from, why did the market fail to embrace the likes of Uber, Lyft and Pinterest last year?"", 'Share buybacks are now a constant of corporate finance, and at the current pace amount to perhaps 2% to 3% of total stock market value per year.', 'But a good portion of that purchasing is simply soaking up the stealth equity issuance through employee stock compensation.', 'So as a swing factor in a $30 trillion stock market, its potency has diminished from a couple years ago.', 'The true issue is a scarcity of stability and growth — or a perceived scarcity of them, at least.', 'We live now in a world where triple-B-rated corporate bonds, the lowest-grade and largest segment of the investment-grade universe, yield 3%.', 'Junk bonds — an asset class with a long-term annualized default rate of 3.5% — now yield 5%.', ""Clearly, the Federal Reserve's three rate cuts and promise to stay on hold for a while is part of this backdrop, as are the stirrings of a global economic pickup following an inflation scare."", 'But the massive demand for cash flows by an aging global investor base and return-starved institutions are the proximate actors on these markets.', 'A winner-take-most dynamic in multiple industries transformed by technology has also created an elite tier of anointed stocks.', 'The acclaimed winners appear entrenched, their platforms self-reinforcing, profit margins sturdy, growth rates near-automatic.', ""This has created a vastly bifurcated market, and an unusually wide spread between the valuation of the most expensive 20% of stocks and the cheapest 20%, as this breakdown by KKR & Co.'s head of global macro Henry McVey illustrates."", "" 'In that upper tier, of course, are the Big Five of tech: Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon and Facebook, together worth $5.2 trillion, or nearly 18% of the S&P 500."", 'The first three, now sporting market values above $1 trillion, in aggregate are worth $3.7 trillion and will likely have net income exceeding $140 billion this year.', ""So, in aggregate Apple-Microsoft-Alphabet trades at 26-times this year's profits, with no debt and enormous capacity to invest, buy back stock or fund future dividends."", 'The broad market is below 19-times earnings.', 'The argument in the market right now is not why these stocks are working, but whether their premiums have grown too generous and investors too complacent about possible disturbances to this happy picture.', ""McVey says, Our analysis does not mean that the \\'winners\\' can\\'t still do well as long-term holdings, but the point is that the consensus has largely caught up to our thinking on the era of low rates and technological change — and what it means for return on capital across business models."", ""It\\'s just that this group today is starting from rich enough valuations that returns will likely be less impressive in coming years."", 'And yet, McVey says, There are just too many broken business models in the value indexes.', 'So simply buying the cheapest is not a clear winning strategy.', 'He favors scanning the middle of the valuation spectrum for companies combing earnings acceleration and dividend growth.', 'The exaggerated crowding into those winners has come at the expense of the average stock, at least on a relative basis.', 'Here we see the equal-weighted S&P 500 sliding relative to the mega-cap dominated index.', 'Over long stretches of time, equal-weighted indexing has outperformed.', 'So is it time to bet the field against the favorites?', 'The forces carrying this rally are fairly rational and understandable.', ""Yet along multiple fronts – technicals, valuation, sentiment – the rally seems near a point where it ought to calm down if it's not going to go fully into unstable blow-off mode."", ""Still, it's hard to figure what might soon short-circuit the cycle of money motivated by an apparent scarcity of cash-generating assets built to withstand a slower-growth, technologically transformed world."", 'The Dow gained 50.46 points, or 0.17%, to close at

8-2 vote, with two dissents: Esther George, president of the Fed's Kansas City regional bank, and Eric Rosengren, head of the Boston Fed, wanted to keep rates unchanged."", 'It was the first time there have been as many as two dissents since December 2017 and suggested that Chairman Jerome Powell may face opposition if he seeks further rate cuts this year.', 'Compared with when the Fed previously cut rates more than a decade ago, the economy is now solid by most measures, if not spectacular.', 'A recession hardly seems imminent.', ""Yet the Fed under Powell has signaled that rising economic pressures, notably from Trump's trade wars and from weakness in Europe, Asia and elsewhere, have become a cause for concern."", ""So has an inflation rate that remains stubbornly below the Fed's 2 percent target level."", 'The idea is that lowering its key short-term rate could encourage borrowing and spending and energize growth.', 'Wall Street has welcomed that prospect with a stock market rally since the start of the year.', ""A key concern expressed by the Powell Fed is that Trump's pursuit of trade conflicts, with his punishing tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars in Chinese and European goods, have escalated uncertainties for American companies."", 'Some companies have put off plans to expand and invest.', 'Powell has also expressed concern about undesirably low inflation.', ""In delivering the Fed's semiannual monetary report to Congress this month, he noted that the central bank needs to prevent the economy from sinking into a low-inflation trap like the one that has bedeviled Japan's economy for more than two decades."", ""Ultra-low inflation can slow growth by causing consumers to postpone purchases, which, in turn, slows consumer spending, the economy's main fuel."", 'Another source of pressure for the Fed has been a relentless series of public attacks by Trump over its rate policy under Powell.', ""Trump has blamed the Fed's four rate hikes in 2018 as a key reason why the U.S. economy is slowing."", ""This week, the president said he wanted to see a large cut in rates as well as an immediate halt in the reduction of the Fed\\'s bond holdings, to avoid putting upward pressure on long-term rates."", ""Powell has asserted that Trump's pressure has had no effect on the rate policies of the Fed, which is considered an independent agency."", ""But the president's incessant criticism raises the question of whether the attacks could eventually undermine confidence that the Fed will remain politically independent and not try to boost the economy before next year's presidential election."", 'Recent government reports- on economic growth, consumer spending and orders for durable manufactured goods - have confirmed that the economy remains on firm footing even with pressures at home and abroad.', ""As a result, some analysts believe the Fed may pause after Wednesday's rate cut to see if the economic outlook further brightens before deciding on any further easing."", 'And skeptics wonder whether Fed rate cuts at this point would really do much to bolster an economy whose borrowing rates are already low.', 'Some even worry that the central bank will be taking a needless risk: By cutting rates now, the Fed is disarming itself of some ammunition it would need in case the economy did slide toward a recession.', 'Some also suggest that by driving rates ever lower, the Fed might be helping to fuel dangerous bubbles in stocks or other risky assets.', 'Yet many market traders foresee two or even three rate cuts this year as the Fed tries to counter global threats that risk spreading to the United States.', ""The Fed's current rate policy marks the continuation of a policy shift made early this year."", 'In December, the Fed had raised its benchmark rate for the fourth time in 2018 and projected two additional rate increases in 2019.', 'At the time, Powell also suggested that the Fed would keep reducing its bond portfolio indefinitely - a step that would further contribute to higher rates.']","['maduro branded guaido u puppet said united states wants invade venezuela', 'maduro running operation looks

is from Virginia, though she could be named to represent another district.', 'On the political issue, speculation has been growing that Shelton would be a strong contender for the chair position should Trump not renominate Powell.', ""The president has been a fierce critic of Powell for the chairman's lead in raising interest rates four times in 2018 and for rolling back the trillions of dollars in asset purchases instituted by his predecessors."", ""Shelton's record on interest rates is somewhat complicated — she has criticized both the near-zero rates instituted during and for several years after the financial crisis, and the more recent moves to raise rates."", 'Trump has pushed the Fed to cut rates and even urged the central bank to look at the negative rates pervasive in parts of Europe.', 'Shelton also has spoken in favor of returning to the gold standard that backs the issuance of U.S. dollars, and opposes the practice of paying interest on reserves that banks store at the Fed.', 'Cowen analyst Jaret Steinberg said there are enough flash points to keep her from being seated.', 'Shelton would be a perfect fit as she would be a Trump loyalist who won Senate confirmation, Steinberg said in a note.', 'We suspect there are enough Republicans who question her views on the gold standard and on excess reserves to put her confirmation in real doubt.', 'To us, the Senate is unlikely to reject her nomination.', 'The most likely outcome is that it just never votes to confirm her.', 'However, the prospect of shutting down Trump nominees comes at a ticklish time for the Senate.', ""The president's impeachment trial is beginning, and a move to scuttle Shelton's move to the Fed could be seen as obstructionist, a profile the Senate may not want with the presidential election less than nine months away."", ""Her views are a little exotic, but I think she\\'s got a pretty good chance of making it, said Greg Valliere, chief global strategist at ABF and

number, or buy one on the dark web.', ""They will often look for one that was issued to someone younger than 18 years old — ensuring that person doesn't have credit history."", 'They then link a fake name, date of birth, and in some cases social media accounts.', 'They start applying for credit and building up a FICO score, which in some cases takes years.', ""It\\'s a really long con and an expensive one, Naftali Harris, co-founder and CEO of San Francisco-based start-up SentiLink, told CNBC."", 'But once you have this fake person who has an 800 credit score, you can then use that to get multiple high limit credit cards and unsecured loans from banks.', 'Credit bureaus link FICO scores to multiple factors — address, name, date of birth — as well as social security number.', ""Harris said it\\'s common for a social security number to be linked to multiple names, because of human error or a name change."", 'As a result, banks often ignore the flag that goes up.', 'SentiLink uses

founder Max Levchin.', 'Levchin is now backing the company, along with Andreessen Horowitz.', 'Harris first came across the type of fraud at Affirm and found that synthetic identities show certain patterns that data can identify.', 'Synthetic identities and real identities behave very differently, he said.', ""Real people show up, in terms of their credit history, roughly when they\\'re 18 or in their twenties and go about their lives living in a pretty ordinary way."", 'Synthetic identities, though, behave in really erratic ways.', 'Harris pointed to red flags like moving around a lot or aggressively growing credit.', 'In many cases, he said they find organized crime rings that produce hundreds of different synthetic identities that behave in the same unusual way.', 'These instances are often under-reported, and categorized as normal credit losses.', 'The Federal Reserve estimates that 80% to 90% of these instances are categorized as a credit losses.', ""People don\\'t know to call it synthetic fraud — they just think someone walked away from a debt they owed, said Jim Cunha senior vice president of secure payments and fintech at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston."", ""It\\'s significantly underreported because most small and medium banks don\\'t believe they\\'re victims of it."", 'There is not always a consumer victim, meaning no one individual is banging down the door of a bank to complain that their identity was stolen.', ""But Cunha highlighted the possibility of criminals using younger peoples' social security numbers since they often don't apply for credit until they're 18 and won't notice a difference in their score."", "" 'This type of fraud has sharply increased over the past decade, according to Julie Conroy, research director for Aite Group\\'s fraud and anti-money laundering practice."", 'In a recent survey, most bankers told the firm that synthetic identity fraud problem is bigger than the losses they take as a result of identity theft.', 'One factor making it easier to piece together real identities is information being sold on the dark web after data breaches.', 'But while HBO Max may be the most robust streaming service as a replacement option for cable TV, it may actually be the least appealing complement for cable TV, at its relatively high price of $14.99 per month.', 'As a result, the winners of the streaming wars
