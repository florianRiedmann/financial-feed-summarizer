Phase two will be figuring out how these services interact with each other and traditional bundled pay television."", ""Streaming services are theoretically future replacement products for pay TV — an anachronistic bundle of linear TV networks that cost somewhere between $60 and $100 per month. There's strong evidence suggesting the general public has begun a movement away from traditional TV toward streaming. About 80 million U.S. households still subscribe to some form of satellite or cable TV, down from a peak of close to 100 million roughly a decade ago, according to LightShed Partners, a technology, media and telecommunications research firm."", 'Then again, 80 million U.S. households is still a huge number. More Americans still subscribe to cable and satellite TV than Netflix, which has about 60 million subscribers, or any other streaming service.', ""The result makes this moment in time an awkward one for the innovation cycle. Disney, Amazon, AT&T, Comcast and Apple are among the largest companies laying the groundwork for a mass transition in media consumption, but their products also work as complements to traditional TV rather than replacements. Still, there's an assumption that streaming services will one day function as replacements, even if the end result is a bundle of streaming services that looks like a skinnier version of traditional TV with better user functionality that's available on all devices all over the world."", 'This pattern of innovation is fairly common, said Brian Hindo, a partner at strategy consulting firm Innosight, who works with media, technology and consumer clients. Innosight was co-founded by Clayton Christensen, author of the seminal business book ""The Innovator\'s Dilemma,"" which details the typical effects of disruptive innovation.', 'Just as cellphones initially operated as complements to landline phones and mini mills were seen as niche manufacturing factories for low-quality steel, streaming services will be incomplete offerings until they reach scale, said Hindo.', '""When disruptive products enter a market, they typically are worse in some meaningful way relative to traditional products,"" Hindo said. ""Their appeal will initially be to certain segments of the market who are willing to accept trade-offs for new benefits.""', 'At this juncture, the three new benefits for streaming services are lower price, new content and mobility, i.e., access to programming anywhere on any device. The drawbacks are lack of quality content, such as live sports, and a confusing array of options, rather than the one-bundle-fits-all approach of cable.', 'If streaming products can actually get to profitability — most of the major companies are predicting they will hit this point in three to five years — they will then be able to expand their reach and improve their offerings to accelerate the demise of cable TV, Hindo said.', 'Historically, publicly traded incumbents, such as Disney and NBCUniversal, have been poorly positioned to keep up with disruptors, said Hindo. They are too wedded to profitable models to purposefully innovate against themselves with niche products that come with disadvantages.', ""Then again, Disney and NBCUniversal know this. Their executives have likely read Christensen's book and other common business-school textbooks about how to properly pivot."", ""NBC's Peacock is perhaps the best example of traditional media's purgatory between innovative disruption and supplemental add-on. According to people familiar with the matter, NBC will announce an advertising-supported version of Peacock that's free to consumers but light on content, pairing it with a limited ad version for about $5 per month and an ad-free version that has Peacock's full offerings for about $10 per month. Comcast customers and, eventually, other pay-TV subscribers will get access to all of Peacock with limited ads for free. In essence, NBCUniversal, which is owned by Comcast, is giving away Peacock as a bonus to those who subscribe to traditional television."", 'Why is NBCUniversal doing this? First, Comcast is a traditional cable company that, all else equal, would like you to continue to buy cable TV. Second, NBCUniversal makes about $6 per month per subscriber for its basic cable networks, which include CNBC, MSNBC, USA, Bravo, E!, Golf Channel and others, according to research firm S&P Global. NBCUniversal makes even more on regional sports networks, of which they own nine, that can cost several dollars per month per subscriber.', ""That means new NBCUniversal CEO Jeff Shell stands to lose $7 to $9 per month for a given household that cuts the cord on cable. Simply swapping cable TV for Peacock, a product that's either free, $5 or $10, is probably going to be a money-losing proposition. Burke said last year he was targeting getting about $5 per month for every Peacock subscriber in advertising revenue. That's a great new revenue stream. It's not a great replacement revenue stream."", ""That may be fine and dandy for a start-up or a private company intent on pushing disruption. It's not so fine for a publicly traded company with a shareholder base and equity analysts making buy/hold/sell decisions on quarterly earnings results."", 'So Comcast CEO Brian Roberts and NBCUniversal chairman Steve Burke came up with a different plan: treat Peacock like an add-on service, not a replacement product. Disney, arguably Comcast\'s biggest rival, has leaned into the disruption by making Disney+ just $6.99 per month with a full catalog of old Disney, ""Star Wars"" and Marvel movies and TV shows. Yet even Disney hasn\'t made ESPN available outside of the traditional bundle, opting to keep the $9 per month per subscriber fees coming instead of accelerating the destruction of cable TV.', 'As I wrote here, AT&T has arguably been the most aggressive about putting together a kitchen sink streaming offering, HBO Max, that comprises much of the best stuff WarnerMedia has to offer. But while HBO Max may be the most robust streaming service as a replacement option for cable TV, it may actually be the least appealing complement for cable TV, at its relatively high price of $14.99 per month.', 'As a result, the winners of the streaming wars will go hand-in-hand with how quickly the traditional world of television unravels. Roberts and Burke have come to the conclusion that the transition from pay TV to streaming is best for NBCUniversal if that movement is as slow as possible. That may be the biggest ""reveal"" from Peacock\'s presentation in New York.', 'Disclosure: Comcast owns NBCUniversal, the parent company of CNBC.', 'Follow @CNBCtech on Twitter for the latest tech industry news.']"

CNMC separated the data into two levels – prime consumers with credit scores of 700 or above and non-prime consumers with credit scores below 700 (the ""New Middle Class"" referred to in the CNMC\'s title). You can check your credit score and read your credit report for free within minutes by joining MoneyTips.', 'As you might expect, prime consumers spent more on all holiday categories, including gifts ($770 compared to $476 for non-prime consumers), travel ($435 to $198), meals ($149 to $118), and decorations ($98 to $90). Prime consumers averaged $172 in charitable contributions over the holidays, but non-prime consumers still managed to average $52 in charitable giving even with a limited budget.', '""Budget"" is the keyword to prevent overspending, especially with non-prime consumers. While 39% of non-prime consumers with a plan overspent, only 24% did when the plan was converted into a strict budget. Non-prime consumers with a strict budget were 56% more likely to have improved finances compared to those with no budget at all. Prime consumers saw the same improvements but to a lesser extent.', ""It's too easy to deviate from a flexible plan compared to a rigid budget – especially when you are tempted by holiday sales. Non-prime consumers who shopped sales were more likely to overspend compared to those who avoided sales (42% to 26%). Prime consumers who shopped sales were similarly prone to overspending (40% to 29%)."", 'Surprisingly, coupon use also correlated to overspending. Non-prime coupon shoppers were more likely to overspend than those who avoided coupons (46% to 31%), while the difference with prime consumers was 41% to 32%.', ""How can you avoid overspending, especially if you're part of the New Middle Class? The CNMC study offers a few suggestions."", ""The study reinforces the importance of a budget, especially for non-prime consumers who don't have the cushion to avoid overspending. Create a realistic holiday budget based on your income and total expenses. Use the budget to create a specific gift list and assign spending limits for each person. One-quarter of non-prime consumers and 31% of prime consumers saved money this way."", ""Do online research and comparison-shop to find the best deals, but don't be lured by sales and coupon offers for items that aren't on your list. Stores are counting on you to overspend, and the survey suggests non-prime shoppers are more susceptible to sales pitches. Perhaps it's easier to think you're saving more money on sale items when you have less money to spend."", ""Track your spending to verify you're sticking to your budget. Two in five non-prime consumers and 38% of prime consumers tracked spending to stay in control of their holiday budget."", 'If unexpected expenses strike during the holidays, adjust your budget to match. That might be simple for prime consumers, but the New Middle Class will probably assume extra debt to deal with unpleasant financial surprises. Adjust your holiday budget to minimize the debt (and the corresponding interest charges if you carry a balance). Homemade gifts can help you scale back expenses, as they did for 9% of prime consumers and 12% of non-prime consumers.', 'In short, you can prevent overspending with a solid budget and the willpower to stick to it.

6,9 Tips to Maximize Free Shipping on Your Holiday Shopping,https://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/finance/2019/december/9-tips-to-maximize-free-shipping-on-your-holiday-shopping,"Sun, 15 Dec 2019 18:48:11 +0000","[""Are you a procrastinator who hasn't started your holiday shopping yet? If not, are you still hunting for deals even after Black Friday, Small Business Saturday, Cyber Monday and Green Monday? In any case, you still want to take advantage of online bargains and free shipping offers."", 'You\'re in luck, thanks to Free Shipping Day on Saturday, December 14. Luke Knowles, the founder of Free Shipping Day and the corresponding website FreeShippingDay.com says that he created the holiday ten years ago ""to cater to procrastinating shoppers like myself.""', 'Prior to Free Shipping Day, consumers tended to stop online shopping in early December, worrying that if they waited any longer their packages might not arrive on time. Knowles knew that retailers were capable of economically delivering mid-December orders by Christmas Eve, and created an annual event that allows retailers to extend online sales and promote new deals while giving consumers more opportunities for late bargains.', 'Consumers quickly recognized the inherent value. By 2010, online sales on Free Shipping Day had already surpassed those of Black Friday by $294 million. The following year, online sales broke $1 billion.', 'According to Knowles, ""The event simplifies the process of holiday shopping, giving people the chance to order gifts online late in the season and receive them in time for the holidays without paying any delivery fees.""', ""Offers from participating merchants will go live on FreeShippingDay.com at 12:01 am Eastern Time and will continue until 11:59 pm. Over 1,000 retailers are expected to participate, including major retail participants such as Kohl's, JCPenney, and Target as well as specialty retail outlets."", 'To participate in Free Shipping Day, a merchant must agree to offer free shipping without a minimum purchase amount for a promised delivery date before Christmas Eve. Offers apply to in-stock, ready-to-ship items. Many of the participating merchants offer free shipping on all items, and some offer special deals just for the occasion.', 'How to Get the Most Out Of Free Shipping Day', ""What's the best way to take advantage of this opportunity? We offer nine tips to assist you in your search for late bargains."", ""1. Scout Out Your Purchases Beforehand – As much fun as it is to browse sites looking for bargains, it's best to go into the holiday with a shopping list and a good idea of which participating retailers are likely to have your preferred items. If you don't have a list, at least review your favorite participating sites a day or two before Free Shipping Day to narrow down the possibilities."", '2. Check the FreeShippingDay.com Website Regularly – If you don\'t see your favorite store listed yet, don\'t give up. Some retailers like to reveal their participation and deals at the last minute. According to Knowles, ""We typically add merchants up until the site switches over, so check back frequently to see if your favorite stores are participating!""', ""3. Stick to your Budget – Impulse buying and overspending undercuts the advantages of Free Shipping Day. If you charge so much that you have to carry an increased balance on your credit card over to the next month, extra Interest charges can easily erase the savings from free shipping. Try to outline your budget constraints before the holiday begins and have the discipline to stick to them – but if you can't, at least consider credit card interest charges as you make your decision. If you want more credit, check out our list of credit card offers."", ""4. Verify Free Shipping Status – Not all merchants are offering free shipping on all items. It's important for you to verify that the item or items you want all qualify for free shipping before you make the final click of approval."", '5. Comparison Shop – Free shipping is not a bargain if the same item is available at another vendor for a low enough price to compensate. Shop around prior to the holiday in order to identify and take advantage of the best deals possible.', '6. Look for Corresponding Coupons – FreeShippingDay.com not only provides free shipping offers, they also offer coupons and special deals for various products from the participating merchants. You may be able to increase your savings beyond the shipping costs.', '7. Check Store Return Policies – Look over the return policy of each retailer before your final purchase to make sure that you understand the return/refund options for any item, especially if discounts or coupons are involved. Note that FreeShippingDay.com does not participate directly in any transaction, and therefore has no role to play regarding returns and refunds.', '8. Send Your Shipments to a Safe Place – Every year, thieves follow behind delivery trucks and steal packages from doorsteps and patios while the recipients are at work and unable to receive the package. Consider having your packages shipped to a safe location – your work, if they allow it, or to a designated neighbor or relative who can receive the packages directly.', '9. Get Free Shipping Every Day with Amazon – In previous years, Amazon offered free shipping on holiday orders of $25 or more. In 2018, for the first time, Amazon offered free shipping on all holiday orders to all U.S. customers, without a minimum spending requirement. This year, the same offer applies until December 18. Of course, Amazon Prime members get free shipping and rapid delivery year-round – for an annual membership fee of $119. In 2019, free delivery for Amazon Prime members also includes one-day delivery and same-day delivery on many items.', 'Free Shipping Day offers procrastinators and bargain shoppers a last chance to enjoy free shipping on Christmas gifts while incorporating potential bargains throughout the process. Take advantage of this day to complete your holiday purchases – or, if you are a procrastinator, to start them.', ""Don't let identity theft stress you out this holiday season.

The office of Trump\'s trade representative said China had consented to ""structural reforms\'\' that would improve intellectual property protection and curb the practice of forcing foreign companies to hand over technology as the price of admission to the Chinese market.

That step would have extended the tariffs to just about everything China sells the United States and would have hit consumer items such as toys and smartphones that have so far largely been spared."", ""Beijing has retaliated by taxing $120 billion in U.S. exports, including soybeans and other farm products that are vital to many of Trump's supporters in rural America."", 'Rob Atkinson, president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, said “the agreement represents progress\'\' but said ""the United States must still comprehensively address China\'s rampant innovation mercantilist practices.\'\'', ""Mary Lovely, a trade economist at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said it is unlikely that Friday's deal delivers enough benefits for the U.S. to outweigh the costs of the trade fight so far."", 'U.S. farmers lost billions of dollars in income, companies paid billions in tariffs and in many cases shifted their supply chains, and consumers saw some prices increase.

8,Fed Leaves Low Rates Alone and Sees No Moves in Near Future,https://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/finance/2019/december/fed-leaves-low-rates-alone-and-sees-no-moves-in-near-future,"Thu, 12 Dec 2019 00:39:21 +0000","['WASHINGTON (AP) - Chairman Jerome Powell made clear Wednesday that the Federal Reserve is prepared to keep its benchmark interest rate very low through at least next year - and possibly longer.', ""Fueling that expectation is the growing belief of Fed officials that inflation will remain tame even as the economy keeps growing modestly and the job market remains solid. The lowest unemployment rate in a half-century - 3.5% - won't necessarily fan high inflation as it might have in the past, Powell suggested at a news conference."", ""On Wednesday, the Fed left its key short-term rate in a low range of 1.5% to 1.75% after having reduced it three times this year. Powell had previously characterized those rate cuts as “insurance” that would offset the drags from the U.S.-China trade war and global slowdown. But on Wednesday, he boldly suggested that the Fed wouldn't likely reverse those cuts for the foreseeable future."", '“Inflation is barely moving up, notwithstanding that unemployment is at 50-year lows and expected to remain there,” Powell said at his news conference. “We have learned that unemployment can remain at quite low levels for an extended period of time without unwanted upward pressure on inflation.”', ""In a further sign of its confidence, the Fed's latest policy statement dropped a phrase it had previously used that referred to “uncertainties” surrounding the economic outlook. This change suggested that the Fed is now less worried about economic risks from trade fights or global slowdown."", ""With the Fed's key rate likely to stay where it is, consumers interested in buying a home or car should continue to enjoy low borrowing costs. Businesses will likely also enjoy lower interest rates. Savers, though, will struggle to earn a return above the inflation rate."", 'Powell signaled that persistently low inflation is allowing the Fed to pursue low-interest rates, or “accommodative,” policies to sustain the 11-year economic expansion and try to create the conditions for more people to find jobs.', '“Even though we are at 3½% unemployment, there is actually more slack out there in a sense,” Powell said. “And the risks of using accommodative monetary policy, our tool, to explore that, are relatively low.”', ""The chairman expressed optimism about the economy and satisfaction that the Fed's rate cuts this year may have helped prolong growth."", '“Both the economy and monetary policy are in a good place,” he said.', 'Many analysts note, though, that the economy faces threats from the trade conflicts, a stumbling manufacturing sector and cutbacks in business investment. Some say the Fed may feel compelled to cut rates at least once next year.', 'Still, in updated forecasts the Fed issued Wednesday, no officials penciled in a rate cut in 2020. Instead, four Fed officials said they expected a rate increase next year. The remaining 13 officials projected no change to rates.', '“If I were Powell, I would say I have things exactly where I want them,” said David Jones, an economist and author of five books on the Fed. “Despite all the people who criticized Powell for not easing sooner or not easing more, it looks like this mid-course correction of three rate cuts was almost perfect in keeping the economy growing on a sustained basis.”', ""For now, the chairman has managed to draw his colleagues on the Fed's policymaking committee fully into his corner. No Fed officials dissented from Wednesday's decision to keep rates unchanged - the first time in five meetings that a vote was unanimous."", ""Powell has suggested that this year's rate cuts have helped lower mortgage rates and spurred growth in home purchases. Auto sales have also remained healthy as more Americans have borrowed to buy cars."", ""Still, Powell's satisfaction with the Fed's policies comes after the central bank executed a U-turn this year. The Fed raised its benchmark short-term rate four times in 2018 after growth began the year at a healthy pace. But as the trade conflicts intensified, the stock market fell at year's end and inflation slowed rather than picked up as expected, the Fed reversed course and cut rates three times."", ""“Toward the end of 2018, there was still a sense that the economy was growing at around 3%, and it didn't,” he said. “I didn't expect to face the challenges, but I think we did face them, and I'm pleased that we moved to support the economy in the way that we did."", ""Fed policymakers have been weighing their options to stabilize short-term lending in money markets. In late September, overnight lending markets seized up, and banks and other financial institutions struggled to find short-term loans. This problem briefly lifted the Fed's benchmark rate out of its target range."", ""Powell said that the Fed's efforts to boost banks' cash reserves by purchasing Treasury bills and its own short-term lending have been effective."", '“For the last couple of months, (short-term lending) markets have been functioning well,” he said.', 'In the longer run, Powell said that the Fed is considering “fairly straightforward, noncontroversial changes"" to financial regulations to make it easier for large banks to provide short-term loans.', 'Copyright 2019 The Associated Press.

13,Fed Cuts Rates for a 3rd Time but Signals It Will Now Pause,https://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/finance/2019/october/fed-cuts-rates-for-a-3rd-time-but-signals-it-will-now-pause,"Wed, 30 Oct 2019 22:29:04 +0000","['WASHINGTON (AP) — The Federal Reserve cut short-term interest rates Wednesday for a third time this year to try to support the economy. But it signaled that it plans no further cuts unless it sees clear evidence that the economic outlook has worsened.', 'For now, Chairman Jerome Powell sounded a bullish note about the economy in a news conference after the Fed’s latest policy meeting. Despite some signs of weakness, the Fed expects growth to continue and the job market to remain strong.', 'Since spring, manufacturing output has stumbled amid trade tensions and slower global growth, while businesses have cut spending on large equipment. But Powell stressed that the Fed doesn’t see those trends weakening the broader economy. Instead, steady hiring is keeping unemployment very low, boosting consumer confidence, and encouraging more spending.', '“Monetary policy is in a good place,” Powell said. “If developments emerge that cause a material reassessment of our outlook we would respond accordingly. Policy is not on a pre-set course.”', 'Some of the global and trade threats that have been bedeviling the economy have receded, Powell said, thereby reducing the need for future rate cuts. The U.S. and China have reached a tentative truce that has cooled their trade war. And the European Union has agreed to extend the deadline for the United Kingdom’s exit from Oct. 31 to Jan. 31, lowering the likelihood of an economically disorderly “no-deal” Brexit.', '“On both, the risks appear to have subsided,” he said. “That could bode well for business confidence and activity over time.”', 'Investors appeared pleased with Powell’s positive take on the economy. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 115 points, or 0.4%. Analysts also noted that the year’s third rate cut had been widely expected and that expectations for another cut at the Fed’s next meeting, in December, were already dim.', '“He clearly set the bar high for rate cuts in December and January,” said Kathy Bostjancic, chief U.S. financial economist at Oxford Economics.', 'But Bostjancic and some other economists say they expect growth to keep slowing and to eventually force the Fed’s hand. Bostjancic expects growth to decline to just 1.6% in 2020, below the Fed’s forecast of 2%, and that the policymakers will cut rates sometime next spring.', 'Powell may be too optimistic about a defusing of the China trade and Brexit threats, Bostjancic said. While President Donald Trump and China’s President Xi Jinping are seeking to agree to an initial pact next month, it would likely leave many significant areas of dispute between the two countries unresolved.', '“He was wearing a little bit of rosy glasses with the trade talks and Brexit,” she said. “Trade tensions are still going to remain.”', 'The Fed’s move Wednesday reduces the short-term rate it controls — which influences many consumer and business loans — to a range between 1.5% and 1.75%.', 'The policymakers dropped from their statement a key phrase they had used since June to indicate that a future rate cut was likely. That phrase said they would “act as appropriate to sustain the expansion.” The Fed’s new statement says instead that it will review the latest economic data as “it assesses the appropriate path” for its benchmark interest rate.', 'Two of the Fed’s policymakers dissented from the decision: Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren and Kansas City Fed President Esther George said they preferred to leave rates alone. Both have dissented from all three rate cuts this year.', 'The economy is in its 11th year of expansion, fueled by consumer spending and a solid if slightly weakened job market. By cutting rates, the Fed has tried to counter uncertainties heightened by Trump’s trade conflicts, a weaker global economy and a decline in U.S. manufacturing.', 'The third rate cut of the year has partly reversed the four hikes that the Fed made last year in response to a strengthening economy. That was before rising global risks led the Fed to change course and begin easing credit. Lower rates are intended to encourage more borrowing and spending.', 'Powell has said that the central bank’s rate reductions were intended as a kind of insurance against threats to the economy. Powell has pointed to similar rate cuts in 1995 and 1998 as precedents in both those cases, the Fed cut rates three times. He and most other Fed officials credit their rate cuts with lowering mortgage rates, boosting home sales and generally keeping the economy on track.', 'The Fed is also weighing the consequences of a decline in expectations for inflation. Lower inflation expectations can be self-fulfilling. This can pose a problem for the Fed because its preferred inflation gauge has been stuck below its 2% target for most of the past seven years.', 'In the meantime, Trump, via Twitter, has renewed his attacks on the Fed for not lowering its benchmark rate closer to zero. The president has contrasted the Fed’s actions unfavorably with central banks in Europe and Japan, which have slashed their rates into negative territory. Though Trump has argued that this puts the United States at a competitive disadvantage, most economists regard negative rates as a sign of weakness.', 'The U.S. economy is still growing, and hiring remains steady, though there have been signs of a slowdown in recent data. Americans cut back on spending at retailers and restaurants last month, a worrisome sign because consumer spending is the leading engine of economic growth. Still, consumer confidence remains high, and shoppers could easily rebound in the coming months.', 'Earlier Wednesday, the government estimated that the economy grew at a tepid but steady 1.9% annual rate during the July-September quarter. That report showed that businesses cut back on their investment in new equipment and buildings by the most in nearly four years.', 'But it also showed that the housing market helped drive growth for the first time in seven quarters, as home purchases and renovations have increased. Powell credited the Fed’s interest rate cuts for spurring those gains, along with greater spending on cars and appliances.', 'Submitted by escamp on August 31, 2015 - 3:04pm', 'Stay informed with the latest from CBN News delivered to your inbox.']"

Buyers are looking to Brazil and Argentina but their output cannot fill the whole gap and their prices are higher.', 'On Wednesday, Beijing announced exemptions from punitive duties for 16 categories of American products.', 'The Chinese exemptions apply to raw materials needed by farmers and factories and some medicines.', 'The Commerce Ministry said Thursday that exemptions were granted if no alternative suppliers could be found or the increase would hurt Chinese industry or the economy.', 'Copyright 2019 The Associated Press.

Stocks fell slightly after the Fed issued its statement at 2 p.m. Eastern time.', ""The central bank reduced its benchmark rate - which affects many loans for households and businesses - by a quarter-point to a range of 2% to 2.25%. It's the first rate cut since December 2008 during the depths of the Great Recession, when the Fed slashed its rate to a record low near zero and kept it there until 2015."", ""The economy is far healthier now despite risks to what's become the longest expansion on record."", ""The Fed's action Wednesday was approved 8-2 vote, with two dissents: Esther George, president of the Fed's Kansas City regional bank, and Eric Rosengren, head of the Boston Fed, wanted to keep rates unchanged."", 'It was the first time there have been as many as two dissents since December 2017 and suggested that Chairman Jerome Powell may face opposition if he seeks further rate cuts this year.', 'Compared with when the Fed previously cut rates more than a decade ago, the economy is now solid by most measures, if not spectacular. Consumers are spending. Unemployment is close to a half-century low. A recession hardly seems imminent.', ""Yet the Fed under Powell has signaled that rising economic pressures, notably from Trump's trade wars and from weakness in Europe, Asia and elsewhere, have become a cause for concern. So has an inflation rate that remains stubbornly below the Fed's 2 percent target level."", 'So the Fed has decided that a rate cut now - and possibly one or more additional cuts to follow - could provide a kind of insurance policy against an economic downturn. The idea is that lowering its key short-term rate could encourage borrowing and spending and energize growth. Wall Street has welcomed that prospect with a stock market rally since the start of the year.', ""A key concern expressed by the Powell Fed is that Trump's pursuit of trade conflicts, with his punishing tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars in Chinese and European goods, have escalated uncertainties for American companies. Some companies have put off plans to expand and invest."", ""Powell has also expressed concern about undesirably low inflation. In delivering the Fed's semiannual monetary report to Congress this month, he noted that the central bank needs to prevent the economy from sinking into a low-inflation trap like the one that has bedeviled Japan's economy for more than two decades. Ultra-low inflation can slow growth by causing consumers to postpone purchases, which, in turn, slows consumer spending, the economy's main fuel."", ""Another source of pressure for the Fed has been a relentless series of public attacks by Trump over its rate policy under Powell. Trump has blamed the Fed's four rate hikes in 2018 as a key reason why the U.S. economy is slowing."", 'This week, the president said he wanted to see a ""large cut"" in rates as well as an immediate halt in the reduction of the Fed\'s bond holdings, to avoid putting upward pressure on long-term rates.', ""Powell has asserted that Trump's pressure has had no effect on the rate policies of the Fed, which is considered an independent agency. But the president's incessant criticism raises the question of whether the attacks could eventually undermine confidence that the Fed will remain politically independent and not try to boost the economy before next year's presidential election."", ""Recent government reports- on economic growth, consumer spending and orders for durable manufactured goods - have confirmed that the economy remains on firm footing even with pressures at home and abroad. As a result, some analysts believe the Fed may pause after Wednesday's rate cut to see if the economic outlook further brightens before deciding on any further easing."", 'And skeptics wonder whether Fed rate cuts at this point would really do much to bolster an economy whose borrowing rates are already low. Some even worry that the central bank will be taking a needless risk: By cutting rates now, the Fed is disarming itself of some ammunition it would need in case the economy did slide toward a recession. Some also suggest that by driving rates ever lower, the Fed might be helping to fuel dangerous bubbles in stocks or other risky assets.', 'Yet many market traders foresee two or even three rate cuts this year as the Fed tries to counter global threats that risk spreading to the United States.', ""The Fed's current rate policy marks the continuation of a policy shift made early this year. In December, the Fed had raised its benchmark rate for the fourth time in 2018 and projected two additional rate increases in 2019. At the time, Powell also suggested that the Fed would keep reducing its bond portfolio indefinitely - a step that would further contribute to higher rates. Stock prices tumbled for days afterward."", 'But in January, Powell and the Fed shifted, indicating that they would be ""patient"" about any changes in rates and implying that rate hikes were off the table. After U.S.-China trade talks initially collapsed in May, the Fed went further and began considering acting to sustain the economic expansion.', 'Copyright 2019 The Associated Press.

Since coming under the PAC, more than a third of its entire book became dud loans in Q2 of FY18, with the gross NPA ratio touching 32 per cent and the net NPAs at 17.30 per cent. ""The presentation to the RBI will be on the key financial numbers. On the capital front and in terms of net NPAs, we have been able to make progress,"" the sources told PTI. A query sent to the bank did not elicit any response. The PCA norms trigger if a bank\'s net NPA crosses 6 per cent or if CRAR (capital to risk weighted assets) is below the regulatory requirement of 10.88 per cent as of March 2019. In the quarter to September 2019, its net NPA stood at 5.97 per cent and tier-1 capital and CRAR improved to 9.52 per cent and 11.98 per cent, respectively. Capital infusion through recap bonds by the government in Q2, and also from LIC, and recovery from stressed accounts have also helped the bank in shoring up its capital position, another person familiar with the matter said. In the second quarter of FY20, the bank received Rs 4,743 crore from LIC, which holds 51 per cent stake, and Rs 4,557 crore from the government which still owns 47.11 per cent. Another positive is the recovery of close to Rs 3,000 crore from the NCLT resolution of Essar Steel and Ruchi Soya in the third quarter, further strengthening the capital position, the sources said. The only area where the bank is still lagging is return on assets (RoA) which continues to remain negative for the fourth consecutive year.

In FY19, RBI removed five banks -- Bank of India, Bank of Maharashtra, Oriental Bank of Commerce, Allahabad Bank and Corporation Bank -- from the PCA framework in two phases after capital support from government that resulted in improvement in their financial parameters. Capital infusion helped these lenders meet requisite capital thresholds and reduce their net NPA levels to below 6 per cent. The monetary authority as an effort to enhance its supervisory framework had introduced the PCA framework, based on structured early intervention mechanism, in December 2002. The framework was subsequently reviewed by the RBI keeping in view the international best practices and recommendations of the working group of the Financial Stability and Development Council (FSDC) on resolution regimes for financial institutions and Financial Sector Legislative Reforms Commission.

The post fell vacant after Viral Acharya resigned on July 23 last year. Patra, as executive director of the central bank, was the principal advisor to the Monetary Policy Department since July 2012. He was also an internal member of the monetary policy committee (MPC). He was in deputation at the International Monetary Fund (IMF) as senior adviser to executive director (India) from December 2008 to June 30, 2012. During the period, Patra was advising the executive board of the IMF in dealing with the global financial crisis and the Euro area sovereign debt crisis “A practising central banker from inside the system and remarkably familiar with Indian financial markets, Dr Patra is sine qua non for monetary policy making,” said Soumya Kanti Ghosh, group chief economic advisor to State Bank of India. “Dr Patra has also pioneered research in the Indian context on monetary conditions index, exchange rate pass through, market microstructure and monetary policy without money,” Ghosh said. While Patra was seen as favourite for the post, many other high-profile names were under contention and that may explain why the government took six months to fill the vacancy. With Patra’s appointment, the RBI has four deputy governors. As deputy governor, Patra will likely get the monetary policy department, which is headed by Deputy Governor B P Kanungo. The internal RBI members of the MPC will have to be reshuffled as the executive director succeeding Patra in RBI should be the new inductee in the committee. Patra is much loved among his colleagues in the department. “Patra listens attentively to even the junior-most officer and is open to ideas,” one of his colleagues said. Like Governor Shaktikanta Das, Patra can be expected to adopt a consultative and cooperative approach with stakeholders in policy making. Sitting next to the governor in policy meetings, Patra can be seen answering critical technical questions in a lucid manner. He prefers staying off the limelight, but when it comes to media workshops on policy, he is there to communicate the complex work in a simple, easy manner. Soft spoken, articulate, and celebrated for his research, Patra was known for hawkish stance, preferring rate hikes at any hint of inflation firming up. However, he advocated rate cuts after Das became the RBI governor, anticipating a slowdown in growth. His penchant for checking inflation was obvious because Patra was a key architect of the policy framework that aimed for flexible inflation targeting. According to the mandate, the RBI will try to keep CPI inflation at around 4 per cent, with a band of 2 percentage points on either side. If the inflation moves outside 2-6 per cent for three successive quarters, the RBI will have to give a written explanation to the Centre why it failed to contain the inflation within the range. While that is unlikely to happen anytime now, even as inflation has hit a 65-month high of 7.35 per cent in December, Patra’s expertise in handling the inflation would be much required at a time when the RBI is also grappling with a slowdown. To revive growth, RBI would be required to cut rates and pump up liquidity support. But that threatens to push up inflation even further. Patra and his colleagues in the MPC will have to trudge through this uncertainty. Patra is a career central banker who joined RBI in 1985. He has worked in various other departments as well, including the Department of Economic Analysis and Policy in charge of international finance, money, and banking. Besides, Patra received professional training at the IMF Institute on Financial Programming and Policy and at the Centre for Central Banking Studies, Bank of England.

Kochhar has also challenged the RBI’s approval in terminating her services. She has said the move was illegal and had no legal base. The central bank on March 13 gave its consent to the bank management on Kochhar’s termination, after the bank fired her on January 31, 2019 The bank has given a composite reply to the court on all the objections that Kochhar has raised. The bank has said that Section 35B of the Banking Regulation Act of 1949, under which Kochhar is seeking nullification of her termination of her services, is a “regulatory provision”. The bank further said that Kochhar was aware that Section 35B is a part of the RBI’s regulatory and supervisory powers and the Section does not confer any right or protection on her part. Also, the Section does not cast a duty on the bank, but is just a form of regulatory oversight by the RBI for the protection of the banking company and its depositors. The bank also said, “The said Section does not govern or regulate the petitioner’s (Kochhar’s) contract of services with the respondent (ICICI Bank)”. Therefore, the petitioner has no locus to make a claim in respect of the alleged violation of the said Section. The bank has raised the objection that Kochhar’s writ petition is not maintainable, that “it is a private banking company and the writ petition seeks to contest what are purely private contractual terms”. Hence, the bank argued that Kochhar’s writ petition did not have legal basis. Moreover, it has said that none of the reliefs sought by Kochhar — declare termination illegal, refrain from recovering and cancelling early retirement benefits and remuneration, permit exercising stock options — seeks compliance with any statutory provisions whatsoever. Also, the reliefs sought by Kochhar, the bank alleged, are of a purely private character and seek to secure performance of contractual obligations allegedly owed by an employer to an employee. The bank has also said that the appointment of Kochhar happened in 1984 and the appointment letter specifically says that Kochhar would be bound by the rules and regulations of the bank. After which, Kochhar’s elevation to various positions from 1985-1998 was communicated to her through promotion letters. Further, no fresh appointment letter was issued to her when she was elevated to the post of executive director in 2001 and MD & CEO in 2009. “Therefore, the petitioner’s (Kochhar) employment with the respondent (ICICI Bank) continued on such terms and conditions as were decided by the board subject to provisions, which were signed by the petitioner from time to time”. Senior counsels Vikram Nankani and Sujay Kantawala are representing Kochhar in the case, while ICICI Bank is being represented by senior counsel Darius Khambata and law firm Veritas Legal. The bank has also said, “It is only upon the board approving appointment/reappointment/termination that an approval from the RBI is sought”. When Kochhar was appointed the executive director of the bank with effect from April 1, 2001, to March 31, 2006, the RBI did not grant prior approval to the appointment before April 1, 2001, but granted its approval subsequently by a letter dated May 29, 2001. “If the petitioner’s contention is accepted that the prior approval under Section 35B does not include a post-facto approval, the appointment of the petitioner as an executive director of the said respondent is itself invalid. The same principle must necessarily apply to the appointment, as the said Section deals evenly with both appointment and termination,” the bank has said in its reply. Meanwhile, the Enforcement Directorate has attached assets and cash belonging to Kochhar and her husband Deepak in connection with the Videocon loan case. The matter will be next heard on January 20.', 'The bank has given a composite reply to the court on all the objections that Kochhar has raised.

The recoveries will be at peak because large assets would have been resolved by March or latest by June,"" Kumar said at a credit conclave organised by Edelweiss.

Referring to credit growth, he said SBI\'syear-to-date credit growth was negative for the first six months of the current fiscal but improved between October to December. ""Our year-on-year credit growth has come down to 5 per cent for domestic market and for international market, it has slowed to 7 per cent,"" he said. According to Kumar, credit growth is going to be muted for some time and the sector may not witness the double-digit growth which it has seen in the past. ""If you are thinking that things will be back to what they were earlier, that I don\'t think is going to (happen) ,"" he said.

Commenting on the National Statistical Office (NSO) GDP forecast, he said the numbers are lower than expectations. According to NSO data released Tuesday, India\'s GDP growth is seen dipping to an 11-year low of 5 per cent in the current fiscal, mainly due to poor showing by manufacturing and construction sectors.

Kumar, however, said the overall financial position of the government has been good. ""The government has not budged on its fiscal deficit targets, though there is a demand for it.
