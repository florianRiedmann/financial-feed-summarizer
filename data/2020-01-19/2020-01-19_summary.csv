0.0006209924069831061,There's strong evidence suggesting the general public has begun a movement away from traditional TV toward streaming.

0.0006509176378624265,Their appeal will initially be to certain segments of the market who are willing to accept trade-offs for new benefits.
0.000622149463146295,"At this juncture, the three new benefits for streaming services are lower price, new content and mobility, i.e., access to programming anywhere on any device."
0.0005800399815458171,"The drawbacks are lack of quality content, such as live sports, and a confusing array of options, rather than the one-bundle-fits-all approach of cable."
0.000659509192793079,"If streaming products can actually get to profitability — most of the major companies are predicting they will hit this point in three to five years — they will then be able to expand their reach and improve their offerings to accelerate the demise of cable TV, Hindo said."
0.0005649347905863603,"Historically, publicly traded incumbents, such as Disney and NBCUniversal, have been poorly positioned to keep up with disruptors, said Hindo."
0.00045530658488279605,They are too wedded to profitable models to purposefully innovate against themselves with niche products that come with disadvantages.

0.0005849972592243046,NBC's Peacock is perhaps the best example of traditional media's purgatory between innovative disruption and supplemental add-on.
0.0006280496878951259,"According to people familiar with the matter, NBC will announce an advertising-supported version of Peacock that's free to consumers but light on content, pairing it with a limited ad version for about $5 per month and an ad-free version that has Peacock's full offerings for about $10 per month."
0.0005797047226491633,"Comcast customers and, eventually, other pay-TV subscribers will get access to all of Peacock with limited ads for free."
2.5837336550192845e-05,Why is NBCUniversal doing this?
0.000618548528586449,"First, Comcast is a traditional cable company that, all else equal, would like you to continue to buy cable TV."
0.0006064147898109406,"Second, NBCUniversal makes about $6 per month per subscriber for its basic cable networks, which include CNBC, MSNBC, USA, Bravo, E!, Golf Channel and others, according to research firm S&P Global."
0.0006304353036093932,"NBCUniversal makes even more on regional sports networks, of which they own nine, that can cost several dollars per month per subscriber."
0.0006371143794282085,That means new NBCUniversal CEO Jeff Shell stands to lose $7 to $9 per month for a given household that cuts the cord on cable.
0.0006187622166729256,"Simply swapping cable TV for Peacock, a product that's either free, $5 or $10, is probably going to be a money-losing proposition."
0.0006352369751034375,Burke said last year he was targeting getting about $5 per month for every Peacock subscriber in advertising revenue.
0.0006064453284760004,That's a great new revenue stream.
0.0005820924346927112,It's not a great replacement revenue stream.

0.0006329797957962662,It's not so fine for a publicly traded company with a shareholder base and equity analysts making buy/hold/sell decisions on quarterly earnings results.
0.0005823358538349992,"So Comcast CEO Brian Roberts and NBCUniversal chairman Steve Burke came up with a different plan: treat Peacock like an add-on service, not a replacement product."
0.0005865133563384065,"Disney, arguably Comcast\'s biggest rival, has leaned into the disruption by making Disney+ just $6.99 per month with a full catalog of old Disney, Star Wars and Marvel movies and TV shows."
0.0006436953723103193,"Yet even Disney hasn\'t made ESPN available outside of the traditional bundle, opting to keep the $9 per month per subscriber fees coming instead of accelerating the destruction of cable TV."
0.0005987885115752578,"As I wrote here, AT&T has arguably been the most aggressive about putting together a kitchen sink streaming offering, HBO Max, that comprises much of the best stuff WarnerMedia has to offer."
0.0006304532841905445,"But while HBO Max may be the most robust streaming service as a replacement option for cable TV, it may actually be the least appealing complement for cable TV, at its relatively high price of $14.99 per month."
0.0006007172175046167,"As a result, the winners of the streaming wars will go hand-in-hand with how quickly the traditional world of television unravels."

0.0006141103691878969,WASHINGTON (AP) - Chairman Jerome Powell made clear Wednesday that the Federal Reserve is prepared to keep its benchmark interest rate very low through at least next year - and possibly longer.
0.0006468827648537644,Fueling that expectation is the growing belief of Fed officials that inflation will remain tame even as the economy keeps growing modestly and the job market remains solid.
0.0006487976304836934,"The lowest unemployment rate in a half-century - 3.5% - won't necessarily fan high inflation as it might have in the past, Powell suggested at a news conference."
0.0006460715785169242,"On Wednesday, the Fed left its key short-term rate in a low range of 1.5% to 1.75% after having reduced it three times this year."
0.0006116503134390104,Powell had previously characterized those rate cuts as “insurance” that would offset the drags from the U.S.-China trade war and global slowdown.
0.000633522404144934,"But on Wednesday, he boldly suggested that the Fed wouldn't likely reverse those cuts for the foreseeable future."
0.0006536432165690286,"“Inflation is barely moving up, notwithstanding that unemployment is at 50-year lows and expected to remain there,” Powell said at his news conference."
0.0006215723650204314,"“We have learned that unemployment can remain at quite low levels for an extended period of time without unwanted upward pressure on inflation.” In a further sign of its confidence, the Fed's latest policy statement dropped a phrase it had previously used that referred to “uncertainties” surrounding the economic outlook."
0.0006416640090483583,This change suggested that the Fed is now less worried about economic risks from trade fights or global slowdown.
0.0006336916217207844,"With the Fed's key rate likely to stay where it is, consumers interested in buying a home or car should continue to enjoy low borrowing costs."
0.0006022400410101346,Businesses will likely also enjoy lower interest rates.
0.0006329051834606612,"Savers, though, will struggle to earn a return above the inflation rate."
0.0006256128653663882,"Powell signaled that persistently low inflation is allowing the Fed to pursue low-interest rates, or “accommodative,” policies to sustain the 11-year economic expansion and try to create the conditions for more people to find jobs."
0.0006334762985850585,"“Even though we are at 3½% unemployment, there is actually more slack out there in a sense,” Powell said."
0.0006254593093511823,"“And the risks of using accommodative monetary policy, our tool, to explore that, are relatively low.” The chairman expressed optimism about the economy and satisfaction that the Fed's rate cuts this year may have helped prolong growth."
0.0006361642028301843,"“Both the economy and monetary policy are in a good place,” he said."
0.0006459993819733027,"Many analysts note, though, that the economy faces threats from the trade conflicts, a stumbling manufacturing sector and cutbacks in business investment."
0.0006198211910869196,Some say the Fed may feel compelled to cut rates at least once next year.
0.0006578486505108178,"Still, in updated forecasts the Fed issued Wednesday, no officials penciled in a rate cut in 2020."
0.0006378713934298616,"Instead, four Fed officials said they expected a rate increase next year."
0.0006133050059785044,The remaining 13 officials projected no change to rates.
0.0006586577939234245,"“If I were Powell, I would say I have things exactly where I want them,” said David Jones, an economist and author of five books on the Fed."
0.000622952021197371,"“Despite all the people who criticized Powell for not easing sooner or not easing more, it looks like this mid-course correction of three rate cuts was almost perfect in keeping the economy growing on a sustained basis.” For now, the chairman has managed to draw his colleagues on the Fed's policymaking committee fully into his corner."
0.0006323246586217124,No Fed officials dissented from Wednesday's decision to keep rates unchanged - the first time in five meetings that a vote was unanimous.

0.0006549483756739582,The Fed raised its benchmark short-term rate four times in 2018 after growth began the year at a healthy pace.
0.0006385234821054874,"But as the trade conflicts intensified, the stock market fell at year's end and inflation slowed rather than picked up as expected, the Fed reversed course and cut rates three times."
0.0006248503016419708,"“Toward the end of 2018, there was still a sense that the economy was growing at around 3%, and it didn't,” he said."

0.0006525396471568569,And skeptics wonder whether Fed rate cuts at this point would really do much to bolster an economy whose borrowing rates are already low.
0.0005742094904417686,"Some even worry that the central bank will be taking a needless risk: By cutting rates now, the Fed is disarming itself of some ammunition it would need in case the economy did slide toward a recession."
