0.0004212677619460663,Phase two will be figuring out how these services interact with each other and traditional bundled pay television.
0.0004281083949308453,Streaming services are theoretically future replacement products for pay TV — an anachronistic bundle of linear TV networks that cost somewhere between $60 and $100 per month.
0.0004333386436146276,There's strong evidence suggesting the general public has begun a movement away from traditional TV toward streaming.

0.0004234490752491867,The result makes this moment in time an awkward one for the innovation cycle.
0.00043852653812397903,"Disney, Amazon, AT&T, Comcast and Apple are among the largest companies laying the groundwork for a mass transition in media consumption, but their products also work as complements to traditional TV rather than replacements."
0.00042843797612147466,"Still, there's an assumption that streaming services will one day function as replacements, even if the end result is a bundle of streaming services that looks like a skinnier version of traditional TV with better user functionality that's available on all devices all over the world."
0.0004276239262993345,"This pattern of innovation is fairly common, said Brian Hindo, a partner at strategy consulting firm Innosight, who works with media, technology and consumer clients."

0.00045533519514867236,Their appeal will initially be to certain segments of the market who are willing to accept trade-offs for new benefits.
0.00043567136635864616,"At this juncture, the three new benefits for streaming services are lower price, new content and mobility, i.e., access to programming anywhere on any device."
0.00040468763473741956,"The drawbacks are lack of quality content, such as live sports, and a confusing array of options, rather than the one-bundle-fits-all approach of cable."
0.00046037877224174,"If streaming products can actually get to profitability — most of the major companies are predicting they will hit this point in three to five years — they will then be able to expand their reach and improve their offerings to accelerate the demise of cable TV, Hindo said."
0.00039408627724699943,"Historically, publicly traded incumbents, such as Disney and NBCUniversal, have been poorly positioned to keep up with disruptors, said Hindo."
0.00031567754128243114,They are too wedded to profitable models to purposefully innovate against themselves with niche products that come with disadvantages.
0.00029092248465778677,"Then again, Disney and NBCUniversal know this."
0.00042437008607576455,Their executives have likely read Christensen's book and other common business-school textbooks about how to properly pivot.
0.00040817468483626357,NBC's Peacock is perhaps the best example of traditional media's purgatory between innovative disruption and supplemental add-on.

0.00040516992728227314,"Comcast customers and, eventually, other pay-TV subscribers will get access to all of Peacock with limited ads for free."
2.0015040803663678e-05,Why is NBCUniversal doing this?
0.0004318918497752114,"First, Comcast is a traditional cable company that, all else equal, would like you to continue to buy cable TV."

0.0004270963862384733,Fueling that expectation is the growing belief of Fed officials that inflation will remain tame even as the economy keeps growing modestly and the job market remains solid.

0.00045655520104903515,"“We have learned that unemployment can remain at quite low levels for an extended period of time without unwanted upward pressure on inflation.” In a further sign of its confidence, the Fed's latest policy statement dropped a phrase it had previously used that referred to “uncertainties” surrounding the economic outlook."
0.0004326589014018921,This change suggested that the Fed is now less worried about economic risks from trade fights or global slowdown.

0.00044228708976845637,The Fed also repeated a pledge to act as appropriate to sustain the expansion - wording that the financial markets have interpreted as a signal for possible future rate cuts.

0.0004335152667299712,The idea is that lowering its key short-term rate could encourage borrowing and spending and energize growth.
0.00043663787769784943,Wall Street has welcomed that prospect with a stock market rally since the start of the year.
0.00043859384948789353,"A key concern expressed by the Powell Fed is that Trump's pursuit of trade conflicts, with his punishing tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars in Chinese and European goods, have escalated uncertainties for American companies."

0.00043681527541285144,Trump has blamed the Fed's four rate hikes in 2018 as a key reason why the U.S. economy is slowing.

0.00044523458783399326,But the president's incessant criticism raises the question of whether the attacks could eventually undermine confidence that the Fed will remain politically independent and not try to boost the economy before next year's presidential election.
0.00044670282162386426,"Recent government reports- on economic growth, consumer spending and orders for durable manufactured goods - have confirmed that the economy remains on firm footing even with pressures at home and abroad."
0.00043758866778607246,"As a result, some analysts believe the Fed may pause after Wednesday's rate cut to see if the economic outlook further brightens before deciding on any further easing."
0.0004484684405301982,And skeptics wonder whether Fed rate cuts at this point would really do much to bolster an economy whose borrowing rates are already low.
0.0004471100571749992,"Some even worry that the central bank will be taking a needless risk: By cutting rates now, the Fed is disarming itself of some ammunition it would need in case the economy did slide toward a recession."
